## Objective

The goal of this project is to help users assess their health based on reported symptoms, by providing indications on whether their symptoms may correspond to a contagious disease, along with safety precautions and insights from similar diagnosed cases.

---

## Application Overview

The application offers several intelligent features aimed at health awareness and disease prevention:

- **Contagion Classification**: Determines whether the given symptoms are associated with a contagious disease.
- **Suspicion Validation**: Allows users to enter a suspected disease and checks whether their symptoms match.
- **Most Similar Patient Finder**: Returns the most similar diagnosed patient based on symptoms, including:
  - Patient ID
  - Whether the disease is contagious
  - Disease name
  - Suggested precautions

## Algorithms Used

### Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

Used to classify whether a disease is contagious based on the symptoms provided.

**Test Results:**

---

### MinHash

Used to find the most similar patient previously diagnosed, based on Jaccard similarity. Offers high performance with results comparable to real vector distance.

### Bloom Filter
Used to verify if a user's symptoms match a suspected disease, helping either reassure or alert the user to potential risks.
